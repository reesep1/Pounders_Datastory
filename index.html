      <h1>Data Collection</h1>
      <p>For my data collection I recorded my listening habits on Spotify,
        recording things like song title, artist, genre, emotions, how much
        I liked the song, etc. The collection process required me to be
        constantly recording data at home, on the bus, and between classes.
        I quickly learned that the most simple cata categories gave me
        significantly more room to make conclusions about my data. Throughout
        the data collection I saw trends in my data beginning to form that I
        would not have seen on my own. The collection has also made me realize
        the best ways to find music that fits my tastes. This also has made me
        realize how easy it is for companies to take data on people and use it
        to make more money by effective ad targeting and selling data.</p>
      <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
      <p>The trends I saw forming in the Data Collection were used to form my
        visualization (seen on the left). Since I was taking data on music
        habits, I knew I wanted to make my data look like soundwaves. I also
        began seeing trends that related the type of song and how it made me
        feel to how much I liked it. In my visualization, I was able to
        represent the genre of the song, how it made me feel, how much I liked
        it, and if I skipped the song or not. I learned not only a lot about
        Inkscape (visualization software), but also a lot about my music habits.
        Out of all of the projects I did, I feel that this was the one that got
        me the most engaged and that I was able to to take the most out of.</p>

      <h1>Explained Video</h1>
      <p>One of the biggest things I learned throughout the creation of the
        Explained Video is proper usage of media in Creative Commons so that I
        did not commit copyright infringement. I also had to create a
        storyboard and list the scenes that would make the script and video
        work together to adequately portray our message. The Explained Video
        also gave me experience using Adobe Premier, learning things like how
        to speed up or slow down, screen record, clip, and cut video and audio
        along with using transitions, fades, and layering of audio and video.
        These allowed me to make the video as smooth as possible and achieve
        the desired effect.</p>
